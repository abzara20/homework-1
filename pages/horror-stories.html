                    This story originates from Mexico, and has several different variations. In English, "La Llorona" translates as "The Weeping Woman". The story goes, that a jealous woman drowned her childeren in a river, and out of grief, drowns herself. She sobs, wandering waterfronts looking for her lost childeren who have already passed. But la Llorona's weeping is an omen of death and misfortune, if you hear the sounds of a weeping woman, it is best to run away before it is too late.

                </div>

                <div class="story__content__text">
                    Originating from Japan, this story tells of the malevolent "Kuchisake-onna", or the "Slit-mouthed Woman". This is an evil spirit whom wears a mask, or obscures their lower half of their face. She approaches to ask a question:
                    "Am I beautiful?"
                    If you answer no, she will kill you, and if you answer yes, she will repeat the question showing you her slit mouth. Answering yes, she'll slit your mouth just like hers, or kill you outright if you say no. 
                    However, there are ways to confuse this spirit and make your escape. If you ask her if you are beautiful, distract her with hard candy, money, or responding that she is average, you may just keep your life.

                    This story is a scary reminder to take care of your skin. One day, a girl that was sunbathing was bitten on the cheek by a spider. Later, the girl had noticed a pimple on her face, and over the course of days, it kept growing bigger and bigger. It became a large boil, and the girl went to seek medical attention. The boil burst then, and hundreds of spiders crawled out of her face. The girl went insane after.
